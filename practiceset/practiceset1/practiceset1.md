#### **CSCI 1300 CS1: Starting Computing**
#### **Naidu/Yeh - Spring 2022**
#### **Practice Set 1 - week of January 17th, 2022**

### Objectives 
* Write algorithms using pseudocode

## Question 1: Washing Dishes
Your chore for this week at home is to wash the dishes, but you are out with friends and cannot come home in time to do them! 
You decide to trade chores with your younger sister. Only problem is, she has never done them before and needs you to explain to her how to do them, step by step. 
</br>
Using **pseudocode**, write an algorithm which allows your sister to take a sink of dirty dishes and turn them to clean dishes. 

## Question 2: 
You are building a weather app that displays the current temperature in both Fahrenheit and Celsius. You only have the temperature data in degrees Fahrenheit, so you need to convert to degrees Celsius. Google tells you that the formula to convert degrees Fahrenheit (F) to degrees Celsius (C) is as follows:
</br>C = (F-32) / 1.8
</br>
Using **pseudocode**, write an algorithm that returns the temperature in degrees Celsius (C) given degrees Fahrenheit (F).

## Question 3:
Using **pseudocode**, write an algorithm that will return a user’s horoscope given their birth month and date.
The horoscopes for birthdays are as follows:
* Aries Dates: March 21 – April 19
* Taurus Dates: April 20 – May 20
* Gemini Dates: May 21 – June 20
* Cancer Dates: June 21 – July 22
* Leo Dates: July 23 – August 22
* Virgo Dates: August 23 – September 22
* Libra Dates: September 23 – October 22
* Scorpio Dates: October 23 – November 21
* Sagittarius Dates: November 22 – December 21
* Capricorn Dates: December 22 – January 19
* Aquarius Dates: January 20 – February 18
* Pisces Dates: February 19 – March 20

## Question 4:
Using **pseudocode**, write an algorithm that asks for a number from the user until the sum of the user’s inputs exceed 100, which is when the program outputs “Congrats on getting to 100!”
## Question 5: Stock Market
Using **pseudocode**, write an algorithm that will take the prices of a stock for 10 days and return the best day to buy the stock and the best day to sell the stock to maximize profits.
</br>Example run:</br>
Input: 
```
Day 1: $3
Day 2: $2
Day 3: $12
Day 4: $3
Day 5: $20
Day 6: $15
Day 7: $1
```
Output:
```
Buy on day 2, sell on day 5
```
